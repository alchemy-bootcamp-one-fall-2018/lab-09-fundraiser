            <img>
            <p>The Barkery is our business model that utilizes local bakers who specialize
                in creating enjoyable edibles for your canine and feline friends.
                In this model bakers make healthy natural treats, with and without cannabinoid
                byproducts. The bakers use local cannabis farmers CBD oil to create the treats.
                The healthy and delicious treats are then used by non-profit anumal rescue shelters
                to treat animals suffering from anxiety, cancers, rashes, old age, and other 
                ailments. The treats can be sold by the non-profits as a fundraiser. The money
                earned from sales will pay eberyone involved to help take care of these animals.
