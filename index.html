        <p> <b>Trailkeepers of Oregon (TKO)</b> is a non-profit organization whose mission is to protect and enhance the Oregon hiking experience through advocacy, stewardship, outreach and education.
        </p><p>
        Our organization was born out of the Portland Hikers Forum, a community forum for hiking enthusiasts that was established in 2006, and has now grown to become the <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/">Oregon Hikers Forum</a>, TKOâ€™s free, online community for hikers. As the original forum grew, a user-built field guide was created and, and has now grown to become the <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Main_Page">Oregon Hikers Field Guide</a>, a free online resource hosted by TKO and maintained by dozens of volunteer authors.
        </p>
        <p>
        Early on, the many volunteers behind the original hiking forum and field guide saw that many of our trails are at risk and in need of active champions and engaged stewards to advocate for them: TKO was formed by the forum community in the fall of 2007  to address these concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
        Today TKO organizes and leads trail advocacy efforts and volunteer trail maintenance activities. Currently, TKO activities are centered around the greater Portland region, but we are gradually expanding our footprint to serve the entire state. TKO also hosts the <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/">Oregon Hikers Forum</a> and the <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Main_Page">Oregon Hikers Field Guide</a> as part of our continuing outreach and education efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
        TKO is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization committed to trail stewardship, advocacy and education in Oregon.
