# Lab 9: Fundraiser Site

This project was created using vanilla Javascript. It's a multi page website where users can view products, add them to their cart, remove them if they don't want them anymore, and then head to checkout. The checkout page displays what they are purchasing (their shopping cart) and has a customer information form that they submit with their shipping address. On the admin side of things, the Admin Product page is where you can add more items to the product inventory, which updates the Order page for users. There is also an Admin Order Summary page that lists out all the customer orders (their address and what items they bought).
